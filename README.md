EPPZShadow
----------

This project is actually the open-sourced portion of eppz!shadow project.

This branch holds everything that needs for a standalon Unity-like hard shadow rendering solution. Being open-source, you have full control over drawcall optimization, shader intergration, also a great starting point to develop custom shadow solutions.

Not works with Unity Free (Indie) since based on camera RenderTexture.
